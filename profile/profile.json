      "description": "The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent (LCM) is a set of bash scripts that provide the functionality to monitor and log resource usage of every node in a cluster. The agent collects hardware information on every node and also collects data on CPU, memory, and disk usage for every node every minute. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. The LCM is an invaluable tool which provides Linux cluster usage data which can be accessed by an LCA team to assess system performance and plan for future resource allocation.",
